# Examples

Examples are written in TypeScript, sorry if you're only a JavaScript user.  
Nevertheless, all the examples are easy to run even if you've never touched TypeScript before.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0x464e/slideshow-video
cd slideshow-video
npm install
npx ts-node examples/example.ts
```

And that's it.

### [duration-looping-demo.ts](https://github.com/0x464e/slideshow-video/blob/master/examples/duration-looping-demo.ts)
Demo about how duration and looping works.  
The demo should be followed via the [duration and looping](https://github.com/0x464e/slideshow-video#duration-looping) 
documentation section.

```sh
npx ts-node duration-looping-demo.ts
```
