## About The Project
This tool allows you to create slideshow videos from images. The goal of this tool is to automate
the creation of slideshow videos, so you don't have to manually tailor settings for every run.

* Different image dimensions?
* Different image counts?
* Different audio durations?
* Loop video if audio duration permits?
* Loop audio if image count permits?

**No problem**, configure your settings once and let the tool do the rest.

Main inspiration for this tool is automated creation of videos from TikTok slideshows. 
With those you never know how many images there will be, what their dimensions will be, 
and how long the audio will be, etc. This tool can reliably and automatically create videos from them.
